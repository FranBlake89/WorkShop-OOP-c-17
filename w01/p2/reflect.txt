REFLECTION

This workshop was very helpful in remembering how to correctly read different files, and how to use the getline function.
The hardest part was remembering and understanding the "rule of three", and how to avoid memory leaks.
Saving a class definition of duplication was difficult to understand because some basic knowledge was not "settled", 
so it cost me to properly perform part 2, having to resort to Professor Fardad's recordings. Although I had used "static" 
in the past, I did not understand the utility. Now I know they are crazy because of the lifetime of the program, only once. Finally, extern, to apply to the global variables for taxes and discounts.
